# 🎛️ GainMeter Plugin

A simple gain control plugin with a real-time peak meter, built using modern C++ and JUCE. 

**Work in Progress:** This project is actively being developed as part of my audio developer portfolio. Core architecture is complete — feature development and polish are ongoing.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Real-time gain adjustment (linear or dB scale)
- Peak meter visualization (per channel)
- Exported as a VST3 and AU plugin
- Built using modern C++ (C++17 or C++20)
- CMake-based JUCE project
- Well-documented and cleanly structured

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- C++
- JUCE Framework
- CMake
- Git / GitHub

## 🧪 Features

- Adjustable gain via slider
- Real-time peak meter display
- Clean UI using JUCE Components
- Modular code using modern OOP patterns
